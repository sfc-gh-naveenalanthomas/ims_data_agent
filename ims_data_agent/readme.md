# FSI Quantitative Research Analytics 

## Introduction
This demo shows how to use curated S&P 500 stock data to explore price trends, forecast performance, construct portfolios, compute returns using common strategies such as equal weighting and inverse volatility, and apply advanced techniques like Monte Carlo simulations. It also supports backtesting with different strategies and benchmarking against the SPY index.

While this demo touches on many areas relevant to quantitative research in financial services, it can be easily customized for specific business or client needs.

### What are the steps in the app?
The users of the app go through the following workflow:

- **Data Collection**: Market data is preloaded for the demo, primarily focused on S&P 500 constituents. No external ETL is needed.
- **Data Exploration**: The Streamlit app helps visualize moving averages, RSI plots (to detect overbought/oversold signals), and run basic time-series forecasting using ARIMA or Prophet models.
- **Portfolio Construction**: Build portfolios using ticker filters such as sector or performance, sourced from S&P 500 data.
- **Portfolio Backtesting**: Run backtests using Equal Weight and Inverse Volatility strategies. View time-series returns, weights allocation, and statistical summaries. SMA-based strategy backtesting is also included.
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Use Monte Carlo simulation to identify optimized portfolio weights. Re-run backtests with these weights and compare them to basic strategies. Visualize how the optimized portfolio performs against SPY.
- **QuantPulse Agent**: Use natural language to ask questions like ‚ÄúWhat was the Sharpe ratio of my portfolio?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow did it perform against SPY?‚Äù

- ### Proc Usage Examples:

    -  There are various PROCs that comes along with the app. They perform the forecasting, backtesting, monte-carlo simulation etc. They can be used in your pipeline as a simple call (if needed) to perform things in bulk.
        ```sql
        CALL <app_name>.CRM.PYTHON_FUNCTIONS.SPROC_FINAL_MODEL(VARCHAR, NUMBER) -- used for forecasting
        CALL <app_name>.CRM.PYTHON_FUNCTIONS.BT_BACKTESTING(VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR) -- used for backtesting
        CALL <app_name>.CRM.PYTHON_FUNCTIONS.BT_BACKTESTING_MONTE_CARLO_WEIGHTS(VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR) -- used for backtesting using Monte-Carlo weights
        CALL <app_name>.CRM.PYTHON_FUNCTIONS.DERIVE_SMA_AGAINST_BENCHMARK(VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR) -- used for performing SMA backtesting against SPY benchmark
        CALL <app_name>.CRM.PYTHON_FUNCTIONS.DERIVE_SMA_AGAINST_BENCHMARK_TW(VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR) -- used for performing SMA backtesting against SPY benchmark using Monte-Carlo weights
        CALL <app_name>.CRM.PYTHON_FUNCTIONS.FORECAST_FACTSET(VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR) -- used for ARIMA based forecasting of prices
        CALL <app_name>.CRM.PYTHON_FUNCTIONS.PERFORM_MONTE_CARLO_SIMULATION(NUMBER, VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR) -- used for performing Monte-Carlo simulation
        CALL <app_name>.CRM.PYTHON_FUNCTIONS.PROPHET_FORECAST_FACTSET(VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR) -- used for forecasting using Facebook prophet library
