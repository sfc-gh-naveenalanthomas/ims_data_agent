# Portfolio Construction, Optimization, and Backtesting Solution

[Portfolio optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_optimization) is a process used by investors to create an optimal portfolio of investments based on their risk tolerance, return expectations, and other criteria. It involves selecting a mix of investments that are expected to generate the highest return for the lowest risk. Backtesting is a process used to evaluate the performance of a portfolio optimization strategy or model over a given period of time. It involves constructing a portfolio based on the strategy and then analyzing how it would have performed over the specified period.

- ### What is the Problem We Are Addressing?

    - Access to high-quality market data to enrich quant research
        - Seamlessly incorporate benchmark datasets like the S&P 500 into your models and investment strategies to generate alpha - without the costs of ETL
    - Shortened data pipelines to generate alpha using backtesting
        - Minimize data management costs and accelerate alpha generating activities like building multi-factor models, backtesting, or risk management
    - Scalable compute for quant trading in a click of a button
        - Lower transaction costs and focus on execution quality with immediate access to multi-cluster compute to run backtests and optimize algorithms
    - Clone Portfolios and Compare returns with clicks
        - Store volumes of data in a cost-effective and efficient way with zero-copy clones that store an infinite number of weekly or monthly snapshots/plots


- ### What Does this Demo Contain?
    - The core part of the demo is to construct portfolios and perform backtesting using various strategies
    - On the Data Analysis Layer, we start with single security analysis by plotting moving averages (SMA10, SMA50, SMA200) for S&P 500 tickers and forecasting using ARIMA and Prophet models
    - Construct portfolios using filters based on S&P 500 constituent data (e.g. sector, industry)
    - Backtest the constructed portfolio using Equal Weights and Inverse Volatility strategies, then move into SMA strategies benchmarking against SPY
    - All transformations and backtesting are performed using Snowpark for Python
    - We leverage Streamlit to visualize results and portfolio analytics


- ### Features Leveraged Within Snowflake as Part of this Demo
    - Snowpark for Python
    - Streamlit
    - Cortex
